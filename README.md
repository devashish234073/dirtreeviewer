# dirtreeviewer

When run with --fName arg it  needs a file containing list of packages each separated by '.' as shown below.
And it displays them as dir structure.

When run with --dir arg , it scans all the child dir and outputs the same structure as above.

It can also ignore particular format with "--ignr" arg. For example in the above screenshot i may want ".cpp" files not to be shown. And I can use "--ignr .cpp" for that.
